# Data Structures Sections & Lecture Repository

Welcome to the collaborative repository for our Data Structures lab and lecture! This repository is designed to be a central place for all course materials.

## Repository Structure

* **`Lectures/`**:
    * Each topic has its own subdirectory (e.g., `01_Arrays/`, `02_List/`).
* **`Section/`**:
    * Each lab has its own subdirectory (e.g., `04_List/`, `05_Linked-Lists/`).
* **`.gitignore`**:
    * Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., build artifacts, IDE-specific files).

## Resources

This section contains links and materials that can aid in your learning.

* **Textbook:** "ADTs, Data Structures, and Problem Solving with C++" by Larry Nyhoff, 2nd Edition.
    * [PDF Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHZOOA0S-1TJ3LhQN3cAajcEhsxuTXtd/view?usp=drive_link)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    * Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/anoz24/Data-Structure-SWE27.git
        ```
2.  **Navigate the Repository:**
    * Explore the `Lectures/`, and `Section/` directories to find the materials you need.
3.  **`.gitignore` Usage:**
    * The `.gitignore` file prevents unnecessary files (like compiled executables or IDE settings) from being committed to the repository.
    * If you encounter issues with unwanted files being tracked, ensure your `.gitignore` file is correctly configured.
