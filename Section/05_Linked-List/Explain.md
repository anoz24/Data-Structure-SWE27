# Linked Lists Explained

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science that offer a dynamic way to store and manage collections of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements in nodes that are linked together using pointers.

## Key Concepts

* **Nodes:** Each element in a linked list is stored in a node. A node typically contains two parts:
    * **Data:** The actual value being stored.
    * **Pointer (or Reference):** A pointer to the next node in the sequence.
* **Head:** The first node in a linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list.
* **Tail:** The last node in a linked list is called the tail. Its pointer points to `NULL` (or `nullptr`), indicating the end of the list.
* **Singly Linked Lists:** Each node has a pointer to the next node only.
* **Doubly Linked Lists:** Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
* **Circular Linked Lists:** The tail node's pointer points back to the head node, creating a circular structure.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

* **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically at runtime, as nodes can be added or removed as needed.
* **Efficient Insertion and Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is efficient, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, as it only requires updating pointers.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Linked lists can use memory more efficiently than arrays, as they don't require contiguous memory allocation.

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

* **Random Access:** Linked lists do not support random access, meaning you cannot directly access an element at a specific index. You must traverse the list from the head to reach the desired node.
* **Extra Memory Usage:** Linked lists require extra memory to store the pointers, which can be a concern for large lists.
* **Traversal Overhead:** Traversing a linked list can be slower than accessing elements in an array, as it requires following pointers from node to node.

## Basic Operations

* **Insertion:** Adding a new node to the list.
* **Deletion:** Removing a node from the list.
* **Traversal:** Visiting each node in the list sequentially.
* **Searching:** Finding a node with a specific value.

## Applications

Linked lists are used in various applications, including:

* Implementing stacks and queues.
* Managing dynamic memory allocation.
* Creating data structures like graphs and trees.
* Implementing undo/redo functionality in software applications.
